Final Project for MA463X: Data Analytics & Statistical Learning.

## Description
We analyzed the breast cancer data set available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). Our goal was to classify the given tumor cells as malignant or benign. We experimented with the following methods:
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Linear Discriminant Analysis & Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA & QDA)
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Bagging
* Boosting

Our final choice based on training/validation results was bagging with logistic regression. This model's accuracy was 96.70% on test (unseen) data.

Our report, which goes into greater deal on our experiments, results, and analysis can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mjxvhvfnkvmr).
